import { Application } from '@feathersjs/express'

/*
  You can (but don't need to) specify your services' data types in here.
  If you do, TypeScript can infer the return types of service methods.

  example:

  export type App = Application<{users: User}>;

  app.service('users').get(1).then(user => {
    user = 5; // this won't compile, because user is known to be of type User
  });
 */
export type App = Application<{}>
